      title: 'Introduction'
      paragraph:
        1: 'The overall objective of the ‘Using Remote Sensing in support of solutions to reduce agricultural water
            productivity gaps’ project of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) supported by the Ministry of
            Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands (DGIS) is to achieve future food security with less water, while using
            water resources in a sustainable manner. Agriculture is a key water user and a careful monitoring of water
            productivity in agriculture is a necessity. The FAO Water Productivity Open Access portal (WaPOR)
            provides new opportunities to exploit spatial information related to water consumption in agriculture and
            water productivity for Africa and Near East. Assessing sustainable use of water resources is evaluated
            using the water accounting framework, utilising a combination of remote sensing data (in this case the
            WaPOR database) open access global datasets and complemented with local measurements on weather
            conditions and river flows.'
        2: 'The Litani River basin is one of the selected pilot basins for making a more comprehensive assessment of
            the multiple water user situation (see Figure 1 for location of the Litani basin). The assessment would
            contribute to better understanding the possible consequences of water productivity increases on other
            water users. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the value of the WaPOR database in preparing water
            accounts for river basins.'
